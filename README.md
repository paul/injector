# Features

# Screencasts

# Requirements

0. [Ruby 2.4.0](https://www.ruby-lang.org)

# Setup

For a secure install, type the following (recommended):

    gem cert --add <(curl --location --silent /gem-public.pem)
    gem install injector --trust-policy MediumSecurity

NOTE: A HighSecurity trust policy would be best but MediumSecurity enables signed gem verification
while allowing the installation of unsigned dependencies since they are beyond the scope of this
gem.

For an insecure install, type the following (not recommended):

    gem install injector

Add the following to your Gemfile:

    gem "injector"

# Usage
